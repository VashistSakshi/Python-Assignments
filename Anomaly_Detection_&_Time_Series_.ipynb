        "**Question 1:** What is Anomaly Detection? Explain its types.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** Anomaly Detection is a data analysis technique used to identify observations that are significantly different from the normal behavior of a dataset. These unusual data points are called anomalies, outliers, or exceptions. Anomalies often indicate important events such as fraud, system failures, data errors, cyber-attacks, or sudden changes in business patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "Types of Anomalies\n",
        "1. Point Anomaly\n",
        "\n",
        "A point anomaly occurs when a single data point is very different from the rest of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "If a customer usually spends around ₹2,000 per month but suddenly makes a transaction of ₹2,00,000, that transaction is a point anomaly.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Contextual Anomaly\n",
        "\n",
        "A contextual anomaly is abnormal only within a specific context such as time, season, or location.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "A temperature of 30°C is normal in summer but abnormal in winter.\n",
        "Similarly, high electricity usage at midnight may be unusual but normal during daytime.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Collective Anomaly\n",
        "\n",
        "A collective anomaly occurs when a group of data points together behave abnormally, even if individual points may appear normal.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "A sudden continuous increase in network traffic over several minutes may indicate a cyber attack. Each individual value may seem normal, but the pattern as a whole is abnormal."

        "**Question 2:** Isolation Forest, DBSCAN, and Local Outlier Factor (LOF)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** **Isolation** Forest is an anomaly detection algorithm based on the idea that anomalies are easier to isolate than normal points. It randomly splits the data using decision trees. Since anomalies are rare and different, they require fewer splits to isolate. It works well with large datasets and high-dimensional data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**DBSCAN** (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a clustering algorithm that groups data points based on density. Points that lie in low-density regions and do not belong to any cluster are considered anomalies. It is useful when data has clusters of irregular shapes or when the number of clusters is unknown.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Local** Outlier Factor (LOF) detects anomalies by comparing the local density of a point with the density of its neighbors. If a point has much lower density than its surrounding points, it is marked as an outlier. LOF is useful for detecting anomalies that are unusual only within their local neighborhood."

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Trend\n",

        "Seasonality refers to patterns that repeat at regular intervals such as daily, monthly, or yearly.\n",

        "Example:\n",
        "Air conditioner sales increase every summer and decrease in winter.\n",

        "3. Cyclical Component\n",
        "\n",
